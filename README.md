## Python Object-Orient Programming Exercise (Springboard/WashU)

This exercise from the Springboard/Washington University in St. Louis Data Engineering Bootcamp explores introductory topics in OOP/class design in Python. This is comprised of two sections:

### 1. Serial Number Generator (serial.py)
This exercise seeks to construct a class that generates integers through an incremental method call.

### 2. Random Word Finder (wordfinder.py)
In this exercise, a RandomWordFinder class is created that parses the unique words from a text document and can generate a random word from the corpus through a method call.
